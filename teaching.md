            <h3>Summer Opportunity for Academic Research (SOAR)</h3>
            <p>I am the lead instructor for students in the Humanistic Social Sciences participating in Emory's <a href="https://gs.emory.edu/diversity/programming/lgs-soar/index.html" target="_blank" >LGS-SOAR </a> program. I virtually instruct undergraduates across the country and cover topics such as academic ethics, research methods, and preparing for graduate school. Please come back at another time to see my slides. </p>
