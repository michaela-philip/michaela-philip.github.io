    <div class='about-body'>
        <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. My research focuses on diverging health and economic outcomes and the policies, both historical and modern, that shape them. I received my B.S. from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2022, where I majored in Public Health and minored in Economics and Mathematics. My background in public health informs my pursuits in Health Economics, Urban Economics, and Economic History. My current work focuses on the impact of race on highway placement by utilizing plausibly exogenous zoning policies.</p>
        <p>Outside of research, I enjoy being outside, going to concerts, and playing music. On any given weekend, I'm likely to be making drinks for my friends, working on a household project, or having my heart broken by an Atlanta sports team.</p>
